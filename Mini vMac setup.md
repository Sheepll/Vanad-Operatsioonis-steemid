#### Installing Mini vMac
There is a sufficient guide available at their own [homepage](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/start.html) that has the necessary information for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

For the hardware emulation to work correctly we need a Macintosh Plus ROM Version 2 or Version 3. A dump of a variety of Mac ROMs is available [here](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macintosh-rom-archive). It is also under the supplementary Mac files in this repository.

The Mini vMac guide also provides us with System 6.0.8 directly from Apple.

#### Installing additional software

You can follow the guide available [here](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/recipes/sys6util/index.html). 

This provides us with a way to use additional software on the emulated system.

A variety of additional software can be found [here](https://www.gryphel.com/c/sw/).
