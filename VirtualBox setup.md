#### Installation of VirtualBox
VirtualBox is available on Windows, MacOS and Linux, you can get it from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

The User Manual available on their website gives a good overview of what the software is capable of doing and what kind of guest operating systems can be run.

#### Installing on Linux distributions
Running VirtualBox may not be as straightforward on Linux hosts as it is on other operating systems. I recommend carefully reading the installation guide created for your specific distribution, otherwise the likelyhood of running into problems is quite high. 

For example, the [Debian guide](https://wiki.debian.org/VirtualBox) has a good "Troubleshooting" section. You can always also read the [ArchWiki guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox) that has plenty examples of running VirtualBox from the command line.
